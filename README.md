First we're unpacking the ravioli.
Then fill a pot with water.
After that put the pot on the stove and start boil it.
Put the ravioli in the pan after the water has started to boil.
Boil the ravioli for 10-15 minutes.
After boiling ravioli, strain its water.
Put ravioli in to a plate and pour yogurt on it.
At the last part (optional) yo can pour sauce on it.

-NOTE: You can find ravioli in markets
